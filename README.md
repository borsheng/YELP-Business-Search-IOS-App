## Overview
The YELP Business Search iOS App is a Swift-based application that allows users to search for businesses and make reservations. Developed using Swift and SwiftUI for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, this app provides various Yelp search functions to help users explore businesses and services according to their preferences. This project was completed as part of a course requirement.

## Features

- **Reservation Management:** Users can make reservations, save them, and manage the reservation list, which persists even after the app is restarted.
- **Social Media Integration:** Option to post business details on Twitter and Facebook.
